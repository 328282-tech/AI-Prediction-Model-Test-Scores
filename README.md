# AI-Prediction-Model-Test-Scores
Is it possible for an AI model to predict the student test scores based on their study and sleep time? In this project, I trained an AI model using Thonny for inputting student data as well  Pandas and Github. The model predicted a score of 86.69 for students who study 6 hours and sleep 8 hours.  This taught me the value of predicting test scores.
