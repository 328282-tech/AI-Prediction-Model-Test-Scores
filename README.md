# AI-Prediction-Model-Test-Scores

 Problem
What problem were you trying to solve? Why does it matter?
Within this project, I trained an AI model in order to determine student test scores depending on their amount of sleep and study time. Discovering this is important given that student test scores heavily rely on these factors.

 Solution
How does your project work? (High-level, no heavy jargon)
Through the use of pyhton code, the model was trained by inputting student data with the aim of predicting an outcome.

Tools
Languages, libraries, datasets, or AI models used.
Thonny, Pandas, scikit, and Github were the tools used in this prject.

Results - Output Screenshot
What worked? (accuracy, output, example, or result)
Overall, the output appeared accurate and the model predicted a test score of 86.69 for students who study an average of 6 hours and sleep 8 hours.

Learning
One important thing you learned from this project.
On the whole, this project assisted me in learning the value of predicting test scores as well as what to do in order to train AI models to do so.
